Key features of the robot are:

* low cost, less than AUD 500
* Raspberry Pi 3B computer with a color camera
* an i/o board with embedded processor that interfaces with motors and provides a simple UI (20x4 OLED display, pushbuttons and other LEDs)
* a simple MATLAB-based API
* ability to run code onboard written in Python or C++

# Mechanical design

The robot has two independently controllable wheels driven by geared DC brushmotors, and a single castor.  The frame is built from laser cut acrylic.
